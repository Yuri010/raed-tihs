# raed-tihs
A Discord bot to make chatting a challenge

# How?
Bot uses webhooks to imitate users and use their name and profile picture.
On every message in the assigned channel it will scramble on a per word basis excluding the first and last characters.
Punctuation leading and trailing words will be ignored too.

Now added profanity filter for basic slurs and checks if user did not try to circumvent this by adding spaces into the message.

# Why
Apparently humans only really need the first and last letter of a word to be in the right place. As long as the rest of the letters are at least correct and somewhere in the word, you will be able to understand it just fine.
So riecailltasly you slohud be able to raed tihs jsut fnie. I figured, why not make it into a bot?!
